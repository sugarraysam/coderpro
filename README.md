# CoderPro [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sugarraysam/coderpro/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/sugarraysam/coderpro?branch=main)

Solutions for [CoderPro](https://www.techseries.dev/products/coderpro) series. Walkthrough of popular interview questions in python.

I provided a complexity analysis of both memory and time for every solution. I am not sharing the problems as this is a proprietary product.

I changed the naming convention to `cp##_<descriptive_name>.py` when I realized this project was growing like crazy.
