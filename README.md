Solutions for [CoderPro](https://www.techseries.dev/products/coderpro) series. Walkthrough of popular interview questions in python.

View [Part 2 in C++: `sugarraysam/coderpro-cpp`](https://github.com/sugarraysam/coderpro-cpp).

I provided a complexity analysis of both memory and time for every solution. I am not sharing the problems as this is a proprietary product.

I changed the naming convention to `cp##_<descriptive_name>.py` when I realized this project was growing like crazy.

And then again to `cpXX/<source>.py` and `cpXX/<source>_test.py`.

# Test

You can run the full test suite:

```bash
# Install python dependencies
$ make install

# Run tests /w coverage statistics
$ make test
```
